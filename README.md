# Aka, ❄️🎄"Snowball Pong!"🎄❄️
###   So basically, we're remaking the iconic, Pong game;
###   However, I will take it upon myself to create the entire pixelated background, characters, and find
###   suitable music to add and update this game.
###   My plan is to find the original Pong Code and modify it to the max for full festivity.


# ❄️Features : 
###   Music will include a long pixelated playlist, and bell noises or a ho-ho-ho sound
###   to announce the winner. 
###   I will also create pixel sprites in either procreate or photoshop to achieve my desired look.
###   Hopefully, I can find a way to bounce the title card or winner card.

# ❄️Challenges :
### I fear I may have forgotten how to do a few things and methods, but that's what the notes are for.
### I have to look everywhere and ask for help on things I know we weren't taught, such as
### making a certain image or logo/sprite rotate and fall down the screen on a loop.
### I know I'm gonna learn how to add music to the file in the first place.
### I need to refreash on how to keep a score or set a limit on what a certain amount of points to win and end the game to it isn't infinate.
### Now that I'm typing this openly I realize how difficult this might actually be.🥲

# ❄️Outcomes :
### Ideally, I hope that I can bling this out as much as possible!
### I hope this can be as cute as it is somewhat fun. As long as I can execute the festivity, than it should be fun?

# ❄️ Milestones :
### Week 1: In this first week, I'm going to find the code and any resources and online tutourials to make this function properly.
### Week 2: Then, I will take to my own artistic skills to design a pixel background tiles, and other art! Additionally I'll need to find good music and sound effets, probable through that one "chipzle" website we were shown through ANGM Fundamentals.
### Week 3: Next week I plan on sifting through my notes to find any more resources to achive this game's theme.

### Pray for me !
